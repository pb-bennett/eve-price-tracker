# eve-price-tracker

A simple price tracking database for market information in the game Eve Online

This app will track price data for certain items in the game Eve Online for 3 system markets: Jita, Amarr and 1DQ1-A. The app will get data for the items once a day and store the information in a MYSQL database. This data will then be available via a REST API.

The next stage of the project will be to build a front end to display this information.
